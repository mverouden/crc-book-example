# Preface {-}

Hi there, this is my great book.

## Why read this book {-}

It is very important...

## Structure of the book {-}

Chapters \@ref(introduction) introduces a new topic, and ...

## Software information and conventions {-}

I used the **knitr**\index{knitr} package [@xie2015] and the **bookdown**\index{bookdown} package [@R-bookdown] to compile my book. My R session information is shown below:

```{r}
xfun::session_info()
```

Package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a typewriter font (e.g., `knitr::knit('foo.Rmd')`). Function names are followed by parentheses (e.g., `bookdown::render_book()`).

## Acknowledgments {-}

A lot of people helped me when I was writing the book.

# About {-}

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Usage {-}

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book {-}

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book {-}

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
